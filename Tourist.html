        <h3>1. Southern Province</h3>
        <h4><u>i. Galle Fort</u></h4>
        <p>Galle Fort or the Dutch Fort is a Portuguese fortress which was built in 1588 at the bay of Galle on the southwestern coast of Sri Lanka.
             This fortress is completed with 14 bastions which is still the best-preserved and best example for the fortified city in Asia built by Europeans by showing the mix of European architectural styles and South Asian traditions.
             UNESCO declared Galle Dutch Fort as a World Heritage in 1988 under the name of Old Town of Galle and its Fortifications. 
             <br><br>It covers an area of 52 hectares inside the walls. A lighthouse installed on the Utrecht bastion, and a tower erected for the jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1883.
             A Protestant church also built in Baroque Style in 1775. The most prominent buildings in the fort complex were the Commander's residence, the arsenal and the gun house.
             The fort of Galle was handed over to the English by Dutch on 1796, one week after the surrender of Colombo. The entrance to the fort is constructed with cut stones, semicircular stones and with arches depicting the nature of a cavern. 
             It appears that these creations signify the specialty in Dutch architecture and technology.<br><br>
             Dutch architects symbolizes their architectural and construction superiority through the creations of Warehouse, Bastian, Dutch Hospital, Protestant Church & Churchyard, Dutch governors & commanders houses and other buildings.
             Architectural style which was popular in the 17th century in Holland was Corinthian patterns. In most of the Dutch buildings in Sri Lanka Corinthian pattern associated with Baroque and Rococo patterns structures could be seen. </p>

        <h4><u>ii. Polhena Beach</u></h4> 
        <p>Located not far from the city centre of Matara, the Polhena Beach offers the perfect atmosphere for a beach getaway, without the crowds of tourists, making it all the more exclusive to anyone who visits the sandy stretch.
             The beach is primarily known to be a place of solitude and peace, so as to induce that sense of calmness in the minds of the traveller. 
             Even the waters are relatively calmer than that experienced in Galle and Weligama, because of the corals acting as a fence of sorts.
             <br><br>Although popular as a picnic beach, there are a few water sports that you can engage in, namely swimming and snorkelling.There are other interesting elements of the Polhena Beach such as the Nilwala River, which runs through the entire city of Matara, eventually falling into the sea through Polhena Beach, which makes it quite a majestic sight.
             It is, however, when the sun starts to set that the true beauty of the beach is shown, as it turns out to be the perfect place to admire the palm-fringed beauty of Sri Lanka's coastal belt.
             There are several vantage points to view the amazing scenery, but it's often the area near the Nilwala River that provides the best vistas.  </p>

        <h3>2. Western Province</h3> 
        <h4><u>Temple of Kalutara</u></h4>
        <p>The Kalutara Bodhiya is an ancient Bo tree which was identified as one of the 32 saplings of the original Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi planted during the reign of king Devanampiyatissa in Anuradhapura during the 2nd century BC. 
            It remains as a very important historical site to this day.According to history that the Bo tree at Kalutara sprouted from a sapling of the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi (The Great Resplendent Fig Tree Symbolising Victory) in Anuradhapura; which itself is a sapling of the very Bo Tree (Ficus religiosa) in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, India underneath which Buddha attained enlightenment.
            The story of how this tree came to Kalutara is quite interesting. The Bo Tree at Buddha Gaya became a subject of veneration after Prince Siddhartha Gautama attained enlightenment while seated under its spreading branches. 
            Centuries later the tree became a symbol of the Buddha's presence and therefore became worshipped. A sapling of the original tree was brought to Sri Lanka by the bhikkhuni Sanghamitta, daughter of the King Asoka and twin sister of the Venerable monk Mahinda who brought Buddhism to Sri Lanka. 
            The sapling was planted in the Mahamehavana Park of Anuradhapura in 288 AD. This became the Sri Maha Bodhi. As the original tree in Bihar was destroyed later on, it is a historical fact that the Sri Maha Bodhi is the world's oldest tree with a documented history.
            Kalutara Bodhiya was developed as a religious place in modern times when the Kalutara Buddhist Society formed in 1931.The society was created so as to take care of the welfare of the Buddhists and the development of Buddhism in the Kalutara area. After the country gained independence in 1948, Sir.
            Cyrill de Soysa , a prominent lawyer, senator and notary public, requested the newly appointed government led by Prime Minister D. S. Senanayake to take measures to remove other establishments the Kalutara Bodhiya site so as to use the place only for religious purposes.</p>

        <p>Independence Memorial Hall in Sri Lanka is mostly popular as a recreational venue for joggers, strolling couples, students from the nearby university and families looking for a refreshing reprieve from the urban environment of Colombo.
            Independence Memorial Hall is located in the Independence Square at Colombo 7. This place is known as Torrington Square in early days. This Hall was built for the commemoration of the independence from British in 1948. The hall was built at the location where the formal ceremony marking the start of self-rule, with the opening of the first parliament by the HRH Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester occurring at a special podium February 4, 1948.
            This Hall is based on the architecture of the Audience Hall( Magul Maduwa) located in Kandy. The column and pillers are decorated with traditional Sri Lankan designs and statues of lions are placed around the building.
            Most of the visitors had missed the museum located in the basement of the Independence Memorial Hall. This was recently renovated and displays many statues of the national heroes, who contributed to the fight for freedom from British government.
            Every architectural square inch of this monument is filled with lavish symbols of the island's rich history and political freedom. At the entrance to the building is an imposing statue of D.S. Senanayake, Sri Lanka's first prime minister, surrounded by four menacing stone lions with protruding eyes.
            These feral guardians were recreated from the lion statues of the 13th century Yapahuwa kingdom. The most prominent feature of the monument, the assembly hall, was inspired by the "Magul Maduwa" the royal court of the King of Kandy, the last kingdom on the island. 
            Incidentally, it was at the Magul Maduwa that the Kandyan chieftains handed over the island's sovereignty to the British throne in 1815.</p>

        <h3>3. Eastern Province</h3>
        <h4><u>Arugam Bay</u></h4>
        <p>Lovely Arugam Bay, a moon-shaped curl of soft sand, is home to a famed point break that many regard as the best surf spot in the country.
             It's a tiny place, with a population of a few hundred, and everything is dotted along a single road which parallels the coast. 
             So in other words, the epitome of the laid-back beach scene that first drew surfers and sun-seekers to Sri Lanka.
            If you're not a surfer, there are plenty of other draws: beachfront guesthouses, oceanside restaurants and a mellow, swing-another-day-in-a-hammock kind of vibe that's totally removed from the brash west-coast beach resorts. 
            Arugam Bay also makes a great base for several adventures in the surrounding hinterland.
             During the low season (November to April) things get extremely quiet and many places close altogether, but it can also be a serene time to visit, with few tourists and verdant landscapes.</p>

        <h4><u>Sri Pada/Adam's Peak</u></h4> 
        <p>Sri Pada also known as Adam's Peak is an ancient pilgrimage site, which has long attracted thousands of pilgrims from all faiths. It is the pilgrimage to the sacred mountain, Sri Pada, popularly known in English as Adam's Peak. This conical mountain is 7,360 feet high, soaring clear above the surrounding mountain ranges. 
            According to history, when the Buddha visited Sri Lanka he placed one foot on the north of the royal city and the other on Sumana-kuta fifteen yojanas, or about hundred miles distant. The legendary evidence of Siam brings up that the Buddha left the print of his left foot on Adam's Peak, and then, in one stride, strode across to Siam, (now Thailand) where he left the impression of his right foot. It is called Phra Sat, and its appearance is supposed to be like that of the foot print on Adam's Peak and of similar size. Broad steps lead up to this walled enclosure containing the rock over which is a tower-like structure.
             The portion marked off as having the imprint of the Buddha's foot is about five feet seven inches long and two feet seven inches broad.
            The hole in the rock in Thailand, which is believed to have the imprint of the Buddha's right foot, is about five feet long and two feet broad. Buddhists attribute this universal size to the fact (such is the belief) that the Buddha was about thirty-five feet tall.
             The real footprint on Adam's Peak is believed to be set in jewels beneath the visible rock and Hindus believe it that of the god Siva. The Tamil name of the rock (Civan-oli-pata) means "the mountain path of Siva's light". Muslims believe the footprint to be that of Adam (hence the name Adam's Peak); Christians, that of St. Thomas, the disciple Jesus. Alongside the rock is a shrine containing images (one of which is made of silver) of the God Saman and a Brahmin priest officiates at this shrine. In front of the shrine is a small table on which pilgrims place camphor and lighted candles.</p>
